#### Functions and closures
- functions are declaredd with a name using the fn keyword in Rust
  * can be nested
  * nested functions are what python calls closures 
- In Rust, closures are anonymous function-like construct you can store in a variable
  * their practical use is mostly with iterators for e.g map, filter, reduce
  * python has lambda functions but they are limited to one statement on a single line
